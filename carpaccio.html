          <p class="step-name">Slice and Arrange the Meat or Fish:</p>
          <ul class="ing-list">
            <li>
              Start by using a sharp knife to delicately slice the chilled meat
              or fish thinly, with the goal of achieving slices that are nearly
              transparent. This process demands careful attention and a steady
              hand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be meticulous and deliberate to create uniformly thin slices that
              contribute to the dish's visual appeal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Carefully place them in a single layer on a chilled serving plate.
              Ensuring that the plate is adequately chilled helps to maintain
              the freshness of the meat or fish.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take care to slightly overlap the slices on the serving plate. By
              doing so, you can create an alluring visual effect that adds depth
              and dimension to the presentation.
            </li>

              Once you have all the ingredients in the bowl, mix them
              thoroughly, ensuring that they blend together harmoniously to
              create a cohesive mixture.

            </li>
            <li>
              Next, delicately add a scattering of capers, strategically placing
