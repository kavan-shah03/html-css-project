        Arancini, a beloved Sicilian delicacy, are delectable rice balls filled with savory ingredients, coated in breadcrumbs, and deep-fried to a golden perfection. The name "arancini" is derived from the Italian word "arancia," meaning orange, due to their round and orange-like appearance. These crispy delights boast a tantalizing contrast of textures, with a crunchy exterior encasing a flavorful, creamy interior.

            <li>
                Gently remove the freshly cooked arancini from the hot oil, ensuring a careful and controlled extraction.        
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the golden-brown arancini to a layer of absorbent paper towels, strategically positioned to effectively drain any excess oil lingering on the surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                Grant the arancini a brief respite, allowing them to rest for a few minutes. This crucial interlude serves the dual purpose of not only further reducing residual oil but also enabling the delectable rice balls to set to perfection.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the short resting period is complete, the arancini are ready to be served, their flavors melded and their exteriors beautifully crisped—a testament to a meticulous draining and setting process.
