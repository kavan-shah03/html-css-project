        Gnocchi, a traditional Italian dish, is a delectable type of pasta made
        from a soft dough of potatoes, flour, and sometimes eggs. These
        delightful, pillow-soft dumplings are renowned for their delicate
        texture and ability to absorb the flavors of accompanying sauces.
        Gnocchi can be served in a variety of ways, from simple butter and sage
        to rich tomato-based sauces or creamy cheese blends. Its versatility and
        comforting appeal have made it a cherished favorite among food
        enthusiasts worldwide.

          <ul class="ing-list">
            <li>
              To start, preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) so it reaches the
              desired temperature for baking.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a fork to pierce the potatoes, ensuring that the heat can
              penetrate them evenly during baking.
            </li>
            <li>
              After piercing, carefully place the prepared potatoes on a baking
              sheet, arranging them in a single layer for even cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
              Allow the potatoes to bake in the preheated oven for approximately
              45 to 60 minutes, or until they are thoroughly cooked and tender
              when tested with a fork.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prioritize checking for tenderness as it's an indicator of their
              readiness to be served.

          <ul class="ing-list">
            <li>
              Carefully take out the potatoes from the oven using oven mitts or
              a kitchen towel to avoid burning yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set the potatoes aside for a few minutes, letting them cool to a
              manageable temperature for handling without causing any discomfort
              or burns.
            </li>
            <li>Peel the potatoes while they are still warm</li>
            <li>
              Press the peeled potatoes through a potato ricer or a fine-mesh
              sieve to achieve a smooth and creamy texture,
            </li>
            <li>
              : Continuously work the potatoes through the ricer or sieve until
              you achieve a smooth and lump-free consistency

          <p class="steps">03</p>
          <p class="step-name">Making Potato Gnocchi:</p>
          <ul class="ing-list">
            <li>
              In a large mixing bowl, combine the riced potatoes, flour, beaten
              egg, salt, and nutmeg (if using).
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the dough has reached the right consistency, prepare a clean
              work surface by lightly dusting it with flour.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take a portion of the dough and begin rolling it gently between
              your palms, gradually elongating it into a long rope-like shape.
              Aim for a diameter of approximately 1/2 inch (1 cm) for the best
              results.
            </li>

          <p class="step-name">
            Preparing Rope Segments for Improved Sauce Adherence:
          </p>
          <ul class="ing-list">
            <li>
              Begin by selecting a sharp knife and cutting the rope into
              manageable segments. Take care to ensure each segment measures
              approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) for an ideal size.
            </li>
            <li>
              As an additional step, consider using the tines of a fork to roll
              each segment. This technique will help create ridges on the
              surface of the segments, thereby improving their ability to hold
              and absorb any accompanying sauce.
