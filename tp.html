    <p class="dish-description">
      Lasagna is a popular Italian dish that consists of multiple layers of
      wide, flat pasta, typically with alternating layers of meat, vegetables,
      cheese, and various seasonings. The pasta is often accompanied by a rich,
      thick sauce, such as a bolognese or marinara sauce, which binds the layers
      together. Cheese, usually ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan, is spread
      between the layers and often forms a deliciously gooey and golden crust on
      top when baked. Lasagna is known for its comforting, hearty, and flavorful
      qualities, making it a favorite dish for many around the world.
